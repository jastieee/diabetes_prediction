# Diabetes Prediction Dataset

## Overview

The `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv` file contains medical and demographic data of patients, curated to assist in predicting the likelihood of diabetes. This dataset includes a range of features such as age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. It is ideal for constructing machine learning models aimed at predicting diabetes based on an individual's medical history and demographic profile.

## Dataset Features

- **Gender**
  - **Description**: The biological sex of the individual.
  - **Categories**: `male`, `female`, `other`
  - **Relevance**: Gender can influence susceptibility to diabetes.

- **Age**
  - **Description**: The age of the individual.
  - **Range**: 0 to 80 years
  - **Relevance**: Older adults are generally at a higher risk for diabetes.

- **Hypertension**
  - **Description**: Indicates whether the individual has persistently elevated blood pressure.
  - **Values**: `0` (No Hypertension), `1` (Has Hypertension)
  - **Relevance**: Hypertension is a risk factor for diabetes.

- **Heart Disease**
  - **Description**: Indicates whether the individual has heart disease.
  - **Values**: `0` (No Heart Disease), `1` (Has Heart Disease)
  - **Relevance**: Heart disease can increase the risk of developing diabetes.

- **Smoking History**
  - **Description**: The individual's smoking habits.
  - **Categories**: `not current`, `former`, `No Info`, `current`, `never`, `ever`
  - **Relevance**: Smoking history is considered a risk factor for diabetes.

- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
  - **Description**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
  - **Range**: 10.16 to 71.55
  - **Categories**: `underweight` (<18.5), `normal` (18.5-24.9), `overweight` (25-29.9), `obese` (â‰¥30)
  - **Relevance**: Higher BMI values are linked to an increased risk of diabetes.

- **HbA1c Level**
  - **Description**: Represents the average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months.
  - **Relevance**: Levels above 6.5% are indicative of diabetes.

- **Blood Glucose Level**
  - **Description**: The amount of glucose in the blood at a given time.
  - **Relevance**: Elevated blood glucose levels are a key indicator of diabetes.

- **Diabetes**
  - **Description**: The target variable indicating the diabetes status of the individual.
  - **Values**: `1` (Positive for Diabetes)
